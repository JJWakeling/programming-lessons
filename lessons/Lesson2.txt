First, download Notepad++

* Using the interpreter:
Meanwhile, redo everything we did last time, but in the interpreter:
	   print, Arithmetic, string concatenation, if, input and comments(just to remind that they exist)

* If, elif and else:
Show example "if.py" and try Exercise 5
     N.b. this example also introduces casting

* While
Show example "while.py"
If student has nothing they desperately want to try, briefly introduce imports and show demo "random.py"
   N.b. now that you're importing stuff, you can only run stuff by creating empty __init__.py file in the directory, navigating to the parent directory and running "python -m Examples.random"
   I have no idea why python works this way

Now you can try Exercises 6, 7
could look at project Euler too, but those problems are quite mathematical, and get tricky really fast
